# [Nutab](https://nutab.braebo.dev)

A sleek new-tab page for managing bookmarks, browsing [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and searching the web.

-   Add and organize bookmarks with folders and tags.
-   Scroll up to browse [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
-   Up and Down arrow keys change search engines when the search bar is focused (or type 'hn', 'ddg', 'so', etc as shortcuts before your query')

You can use it by setting the url as your new tab page: https://nutab.braebo.dev

To test the browser extension version _(wip)_, load the "build" folder as an "unpacked" extension.
